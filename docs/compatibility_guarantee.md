# PyneScript Compatibility Guarantee

Repo-root distillation of the same map.

## Executive Summary

**PYNE** (PyPI **`hoox-pyne`**, import `pynescript`) provides strong syntax compatibility (full parser coverage for v5/v6 grammar on real scripts) and good semantic compatibility with TradingView® Pine Script™ v5/v6. The parser, AST, and builtins (including technical indicators and strategy support) are implemented and covered by tests.

**Compatibility is not full TradingView® platform parity.** PYNE is an independent language engine, not a hosted chart host, not a proprietary multi-symbol data feed, and not an editor UI. Numerical results match reference Pine within floating-point bounds on the supported surface — they are not bit-identical on every script or bar.

**Interpret ↔ compile plot parity** is a first-class testing pillar: same script + OHLCV under `Runtime.run(..., mode="interpret")` vs `mode="compile"`, compared with nan-aware allclose (`scripts/compare_interp_compile.py`, `tests/test_interp_compile_parity.py`). Residual value `MISMATCH` buckets and structural hline/fill key differences are tracked deliberately.

**Foreign `request.*` / NA policy:** compile does not invent multi-asset series. Same-symbol simple OHLCV may lower; foreign tickers and complex `request.security` expressions resolve to `na` on both backends when data is absent (prefer honest NA over chart-close-as-foreign).

## Compatibility Metrics

The product-facing numbers below come from the live dispatch surface and the open-source corpus (set01–04, measured locally, **not shipped** in git):

| Category | Result | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Dispatch builtins (callable) | **941** | Live `NodeLiteralEvaluator` map |
| Dispatch namespaces | **255** | `ta`, `strategy`, `array`, `matrix`, … |
| Official TV v6 function reference | **434 symbols — 0 missing** | A registered name is not the same as hosted-platform semantics |
| Partial-heuristic dispatch entries | **10** | Stub/mock docstrings; real partials may be higher |
| Parse + unparse (set01–04) | **99.96%** (2,476/2,477) | Residual: 1 intentional invalid line-wrap demo |
| Runtime interpret (50 bars) | **100%** excl. EXPECTED_FAIL | 2466 OK + 11 intentional demos |
| set01 Runtime | **249/249** (100%) | |

EXPECTED_FAIL scripts are path-listed intentional demos — not silent suppression.

## Grouped Map (distilled)

| Class | Scope | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Working** | Implemented, usable, covered by first-party tests | Language core, series, TA hot path, collections, strategy broker, drawings, alerts, libraries, interpret Runtime |
| **Partial** | Callable but mock, host-bound, or incomplete vs hosted Pine | `request.*` feeds (honest `na`), compile eligibility, nopython compile alerts (`[]`; object-mode compile exports firings), PyneTS vs Python oracle |
| **Residual** | Known open hole on an otherwise landed surface | Plot MISMATCH corpus tail (P1p official builtins closed), `PYNE_SERIES_RING` default off |
| **Out of scope** | Intentionally not a TV platform clone | Pixel chart, editor UX, foreign live fundamentals, bit-identical TV bars |

---

## Key Guarantees (honestly scoped)

1. **Syntax:** All valid Pine Script v5/v6 grammar in the resource grammar parses. Round-trip `parse → unparse → parse` preserves semantics (whitespace may differ).
2. **Language surface:** 0 missing dispatch entries vs the public TV v6 function reference list. Registered callables exist; semantic parity is best-effort, not guaranteed identical on every edge.
3. **Numerical:** Errors within IEEE 754 floating-point limits on validated kernels (see `docs/numerical_validation_report.md`, v1.0 Nov 2025). Not eternal SLAs — re-validate after smoother changes.
4. **Foreign data:** Honest `na` — no inventing chart close as foreign fundamentals.
5. **Alerts:** `alert()` / `alertcondition()` firings exported on `/run`; L2 webhooks optional.

## Known Limitations

### By design (not compatibility issues)

| Area | Limitation | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Real-time data | No live market feeds | Library design; use external data provider |
| Plot rendering | No chart visualization | AST focus; pixels are AXIS / clients |
| Request functions | Mock / same-symbol; foreign → `na` | Requires external API integration; honest NA policy |
| Strategy backtesting | OHLC-path broker simulation, not tick-path | In-process model only |
| Pixel chart / editor UI | Not this runtime | AXIS / editor clients are separate products |

## Verification Resources

### Run tests yourself

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/hoox-sh/pyne.git
cd pynescript

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[lsp,pro,compile]"

# Core unit slice
python -m pytest tests/test_linter.py tests/test_evaluator.py tests/test_cli.py -q

# Interpret ↔ compile parity
pytest tests/test_interp_compile_parity.py -q

# Incremental TA parity
pytest tests/test_ta_incremental.py -q
```

Numerical validation: see `docs/numerical_validation_report.md`.

Real-world scripts: first-party fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`. Third-party corpora are not shipped.
