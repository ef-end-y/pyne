# Documentation writing rules (PYNE + AXIS)

Source of truth for agents authoring MDX under `docs/pyne/` and `docs/axis/`.
Hosted (Phase B) at `https://hoox.sh/pyne/docs` and `https://hoox.sh/axis/docs`.

## Audience

`docs/pyne/**` and `docs/axis/**` are **public product docs** for end users and
external developers only.

Never document:

- Cost estimates, dollar amounts, monthly GCP bills, or free-tier spend planning
- Personal PyPI or GitHub accounts (e.g. `jango-blockchained` remotes)
- Trusted Publishing / API-token shipping, `PYPI_API_TOKEN`, or
  `gh secret set` for hoox-sh
- VPS / Hetzner / `deploy_vps.sh`, or machine-local paths like `/home/jango/...`

Operator and internal shipping belong in `AGENTS.md`, root `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
and `scripts/build/README.md` — not in Mintlify MDX.

Developer-facing internals (repo paths under `src/`, self-host Docker, env vars
the code reads) are in-scope.

Copyright headers with `jango_blockchained` stay (license). Public `hoox-sh/*`
GitHub orgs are fine.

## Products

| Tree | Public base | Brand pack (hoox.sh) |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `docs/pyne/**` | `/pyne/docs` | volt |
| `docs/axis/**` | `/axis/docs` | void |

Never put AXIS pages under `docs/pyne/` or PYNE language theory under `docs/axis/`
beyond short cross-links.

## Links

- PYNE internal: `/pyne/docs/enduser/getting-started/installation`
- AXIS internal: `/axis/docs/plugins/contracts`
- HOOX mesh: `/docs/...`
- Cross: always include product prefix

`{/* TODO: verify */}` when unsure. No Sphinx directives.

Pine Script™ / TradingView® disclaimer once per product `index.mdx` only.
